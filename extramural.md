# Casson Stallings - Extramural and Consulting Projects #

## Extramural Projects ##
I did the first two projects for fun. The first is a continuation of a project done 
while at a data science boot camp. They were two of the first data science articles 
published on Domino Data Lab’s blog.  


### Crunchbase Network Analysis with Python ###
In 2014 Crunchbase converted their backend database to a Neo4j graph database to better
represent the many relationships in their data. Originally written as a student project 
at the Zipfian Academy (now Galvanize), Visibly Connected II facilitates the network 
construction from and analysis of Crunchbase data. The article published on Domino Data 
Lab's blog, presents an analysis of acquisitions represented in the Crunchbase data. 
The software, data, and results were available for anyone to try on DominoDataLab.com, 
but appear not to be at this time.

### Error Bounds Using Little-Bag-Of-Bootstraps ### 
Calculating error bounds on metrics derived from very large data sets and with some machine 
learning techniques can be problematic. In more traditional statistics one can put a confidence 
interval or error bound on most metrics, parameters, or classifications. In this article I discuss 
the little-bag-of-bootstraps, its advantages over more traditional bootstrapping, and give two 
examples pertinent to machine learning. The full article, code, data, results, and references were 
publicly available on DominoDataLab.com, but appear not to be at this time.

### Predicting Homelessness in New York City with the SumAll Foundation ###
The SumAll Foundation worked with the NYC Department of Homeless Services (DHS) in 
an attempt to better target the efforts of DHS. This was a group effort. I contributed 
by processing and georeferencing data. I was not involved in the writing, but the 
article below describes the project.

## Articles Based on Independent Consulting Work ##
While consulting for FutureAdvisor I conducted a number of small research projects. I did 
all ETL on the external data, generated working databases, and then analyzed all external 
and internal data used in these articles. Based on my analyses I generated summaries with 
bullet points, graphs, and tables. The summaries were provided to the authors who wrote the 
articles and in some cases contributed additional graphics. The one exception is Simon 
Moore, who did his own analysis on data I provided.
